I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Oslo Business School (OsloMet). I am supervised by Prof. Anders Kjelsurd and Prof. Fenella Carpena.

I am broadly interested in developmental issues in low- and middle-income countries. My current research uses tools from applied microeconomics to study questions on environment, education, and political economy.
